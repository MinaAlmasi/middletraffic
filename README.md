## üöå About 
This repository contains scripts for developing a pipeline to forecast passenger occupancy at various bus stops on Midttrafik's route 1A in Aarhus. We trained several *NeuralProphet models* (via grid search), a *SARIMA* model, and three baselines. The main analysis was focused on the bus stop *N√∏rreport*. 

To reproduce the pipeline, see the [Setup](#Ô∏è-setup) and [Usage](#-usage) sections. Note that the initial preprocessing of `1A` cannot be reproduced as the file is not shareable. However, data for the five processed bus stops is available in the `data` folder.

### Project Overview
The repository is structured as such: 
| Folder/File               | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| `data/`                   | Contains five bus stops from 1A (raw and aggregated)|
| `raw_data/`               | Empty folder where the raw data can be placed for the initial processing to run |
| `plots/`                  | Plots used in the paper and appendix |
| `results/`                | Evaluation results and forecasts for the main analysis |
| `src/`                    | Python code related to the project. |


For a greater overview of the Python code, see the [src/README.md](src/README.md).

## üíª Technical Requirements
Grid search and model training was run via  Ubuntu v22.04.3, Python v3.10.12 (UCloud, Coder Python 1.86.2). Other analysis work such as plotting was done locally on a Macbook Pro ‚Äò13 (2020, 2 GHz Intel i5, 16GB of ram). 

Python's venv need to be installed for the code to run as intended. 

*Please also note that the advanced models were computionally intensive and were run on a 64 machine on UCloud* 

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
Prior to running the code, run the command below to create a virtual environment (`env`) and install necessary packages within it: 
```
bash setup.sh
```

##  üöÄ Usage 
To run any script, you can type in the terminal as such (with the `env`active):
```bash
# activate env
source env/bin/activate

# run script
python src/neural-prophet/test_prophet.py

# quit env 
deactivate
```
For the full overview of scripts, please refer to the [Project Overview](#project-overview) and [src/README.md](src/README.md). Note that you cannot run most files in `process_data` as the raw data is not available on Git.
